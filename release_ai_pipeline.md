# Releasing an AI Pipeline

After completing the design of the pipeline, you can release it online. Before that, you can choose to save the pipeline, export the pipeline configuration, revert it to an online version (if available), or set the alarm sending method.

- **Save pipeline**: Click **Save** to save the pipeline configuration. Only saved pipeline can be released.
- **Export configuration**: If you want to reuse the pipeline configuration, click **Export** to export the pipeline configuration to local directory. When creating pipelines in the future, you can choose to import the existing pipeline configuration file.
- **Revert to online version**: When you are in the progress of editing the pipeline configuration of an online version and get unsatisfied with the changes, click **Revert to online version** to roll back to the online version.
- **Alarm setting**: For each pipeline, an alarm can be set to report errors through email or SMS. Click **Alarm setting** to complete the alarm setting. When errors are reported for running pipelines, the owner of the pipeline will receive notification.
- **Release pipeline**: After editing and saving the pipeline configuration, click **Release** to release the pipeline online. Note: before release the pipeline, ensure that the pipeline does not have an online running version.
