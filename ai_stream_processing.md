# AI Stream Processing

AI (analogy input)  consists of physical parameters like temperature, pressure, flow, etc. The values of these parameters are collected by various sensors, converted to electric signals by transmitter, and transferred to the analogy input of the controller. For this kind of data, EnOS Streaming System provides unified templates to enable developers to process AI real-time data easily and quickly.

AI real-time data processing consists of the following steps:

1. Designing and creating an AI processing pipeline

2. Releasing the pipeline online

3. Monitoring the pipeline status

4. Viewing pipeline running results
