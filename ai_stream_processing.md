# AI Data Streaming

AI (analogy input)  data consist of physical parameters like temperature, pressure, flow, etc. The values of these parameters are collected by various sensors, converted to electric signals by a transmitter, and transferred to the analogy input of the controller. For this kind of data, EnOS Streaming System provides unified templates to enable developers to process AI real-time data easily and quickly.

AI real-time data streaming procedure consists of the following steps:

1. Designing and creating an AI data processing pipeline

2. Releasing the processing pipeline online

3. Monitoring the pipeline status

4. Viewing pipeline running results
